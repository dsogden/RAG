# A basic LLM RAG chatbot with LangChain

This repo contains the source code for an LLM RAG chatbot, built with LangChain. The goal of the project was to learn to build out a basic implementation of a chatbot that will retrieve some general facts about baseball (i.e. pitching rules, pitch grips, and how to play the game).
